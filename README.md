# The matrix

This reposotory is www.mypdns.org self maintained list of domains that needs to 
be blocked for various reasons.

# Source list
The `source` folder contains several subfolders, each named as groups, for which 
a submission should be put. This however doens't nessesary mean that one domain 
can't be put into several 'groups'

E.g. `google.*` which belongs to several groups as they represents all online 
evil when we talks privacy and anti brainwash/manipulation; Facebook is also well
representented in several gategories.

# Categorising
Each subfolder of `sources` should contain it's own README which in short 
describe what the list is all about and criteria to add a domain into it's 
`domain.list` or `wildcard.list`

# Whitelist
This list have it's very own life, as this is a very very tricky one to maintain.

The reason for that is, it have to balance between what is going on with a domain
that for several reasons might be blacklisted on some lists but not on others. It
can also be that a domain in general do 99,9& right, but because of it's nature
of user based submissions, could do a lot of evil.

E.g. Gitlab
Gitlab is 100% user submitted contents, but for the same reason also a widely 
target from bad guys to host there evil code. For that rightfully reason Gitlab 
often pop ups on list for malicious code. But as that would have huge inpluence
on our workflow, it's ofcurse to be whitelisted.
